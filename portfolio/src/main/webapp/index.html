            Hi everyone! My name is Alexander Schlesinger, but you can call me Alex. </br>
            I am a Sophomore CS major at Yeshiva University in NYC, and I am the Founding President of our University's Fintech Society and Blockchain Society. </br>
            Outside of class, I enjoy playing sports (especially basketball, soccer, and table tennis), hanging out with family and friends, and continuously learning new things!
