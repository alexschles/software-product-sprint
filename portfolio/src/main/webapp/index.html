            Hi everyone! My name is Alexander Schlesinger, but you can call me Alex. </br></br>
            I am a Sophomore CS major at Yeshiva University in NYC.</br> </br>
            Outside of class, I enjoy playing sports (especially basketball, soccer, and table tennis), hanging out with family and friends, and continuously learning new things!
